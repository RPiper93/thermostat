Thermostat
=============

Week 5 Weekly Challenge for Ronin
---------

For the challenges in the fifth week, JavaScript week, we had to make a Thermostat page. This page had a default temperature of 20 degrees, and the temperature could be increased or decreased by pressing the correct buttons. It could also be reset.

We added a power-saving mode, which changed the maximum temperature depending on if it was in power-saving mode or not.

After this, we included a Weather API which meant that the thermostat displayed the outside temperature. This was then refined to work for a selection of cities.
